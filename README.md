# Generate YouTube Chapters from your DaVinci Resolve Marker File (EDL)
Hi! This is a software that can help you to generate YouTube Chapters form DaVinci Resolve Markers.

## Version
- For export your marker file, you need DaVinci Resolve 17;
- When there is a new **stable** version of DaVinci, the software will be updated.

## Requirements
- You need a Windows PC, the program in not compatible with Mac or Linux.
- You can also have Windows XP, the script will still work.

## Instructions
- Make sure that the markers you want to convert in YouTube chapters are **Cyan** and the **title of evety marker is the description you want to give to the specific chapter**;
